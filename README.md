Sahil Gupta's Portfolio<br>
Welcome to my portfolio! This project is inspired by the design and user interface of Netflix. It showcases my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is optimized specifically for desktop users.

Interactive elements: Smooth transitions, hover effects, and interactive sections for an engaging user experience.<br>
Showcase of projects: A collection of my best work presented in a visually appealing way.<br>
Technologies<br>
